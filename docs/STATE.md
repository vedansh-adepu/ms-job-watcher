# ms-job-watcher — Session Handoff

## Current status

**Four pipelines running — ~9,691 total boards.** External triggering via cron-job.org for all four; daily watchdog fires at 09:00 UTC via GitHub-native schedule (no PAT required). Pipeline 1 (`--mode main`) polls Microsoft, NVIDIA, Amazon, Goldman Sachs, IBM, and Oracle (10-min cadence). Pipeline 2 (`boards.yml`) sweeps 1,200 ATS boards in batches of 200 (30-min cadence). Pipeline 3 (`boards2.yml`) sweeps 6,166 GH+Lever boards in batches of 2,000 (30-min cadence). **Pipeline 4 (`boards3.yml`) sweeps 2,325 Workday boards in batches of 20 (30-min cadence, 58.5h full cycle) — first `[Boards3 Alerts]` expected ~2026-07-11; silence before then is EXPECTED.** Tracking layer COMPLETE as of 2026-07-08: schema validation on all state-file loaders, per-pipeline silent-source alarm (3 consecutive zeros → `[Watcher ALERT]`), daily watchdog (`GITHUB_TOKEN`, survives PAT expiry), and per-pipeline emailed-job records. Watchdog verified 2026-07-09T02:24Z: all four pipelines healthy (main 2.8 min · boards 20.8 min · boards2 22.3 min · boards3 14.2 min), no false alert, 8s runtime.

> **PAT SECURITY REMINDER (2026-07-01):** The fine-grained PAT used to trigger all **four** cron-job.org jobs was **exposed in a screenshot on 2026-07-01**. It expires **2026-08-31** — rotate it well before that date. On rotation: update the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header in **all four** cron-job.org jobs (watcher, boards, boards2, boards3). The watchdog (`GITHUB_TOKEN`-based) catches expiry within 24h but does not prevent it.

## Open bugs / issues

- [x] **External scheduling via cron-job.org is live and verified in production.** GitHub cron deprioritization confirmed (median 268/273 min despite 10/30-min target). Switched to cron-job.org → `workflow_dispatch` API: watcher every 10 min, boards every 30 min. Verified via `gh run list`: watcher `workflow_dispatch` runs landed at 20:40 and 20:50 UTC on Jun 2, exactly 10 min apart, all success. Boards dispatch confirmed (204 + successful run). GitHub `schedule:` downgraded to sparse fallback (`13 */3 * * *`). PAT expires 2026-08-31.
- [ ] **Dead-board single-strike permanent marking — no resurrection.** One 404/410 = dead forever. 16 boards in current CSV are marked dead; some may be transient failures. Implement N-strikes (3 consecutive) or monthly TTL re-probe.
- [ ] **`boards_dead.json` has 921 orphaned entries (stale, not wasting throughput but misleading).** Only 16 of 937 entries overlap with the current CSV. Prune to match live CSV.
- [ ] **Large untapped board pool.** `greenhouse_us_verified.csv` (4,659 rows), `lever_us_verified.csv` (1,806 rows), `workday_us_verified.csv` (4,770 rows) — none ingested. Verify first, add in tranches.
- [ ] **Gmail account mismatch.** Connected Gmail is the wrong account; the alerts inbox hasn't been analyzed. Reconnect the correct inbox before doing Gmail-based funnel analysis.

## Next steps

1. **After ~1 day of live dispatch runs, check `run_log.json` funnel data** — look at per-source `title_ok` and `loc_ok` counts to confirm the title classifier isn't over-dropping. If a source's "kept" count drops sharply after a filter tweak, that's the signal. Recall-first: err toward alerting.
2. **Reconnect the correct Gmail inbox**, then analyze which boards actually produce relevant alerts.
3. **Selectively ingest from the ~10k curated lists** (greenhouse/lever/workday_us_verified) — verify first, add in tranches; do NOT bulk-add (cycle staleness wrecks latency).
4. **[low] Dead-board resurrection + prune orphaned entries** — implement N-strikes (3 consecutive 404s) or monthly TTL re-probe instead of single-strike permanent marking; prune `boards_dead.json` down to the 16 entries that actually overlap the current CSV (921 are stale orphans).
5. **[optional, deferred by choice] Automated test harness** — pytest on `classify_title` / `is_us_location` was considered and deliberately deferred. `run_log.json` is the lightweight safety net for regressions. Not urgent unless the classifier is changed.

## Key facts & gotchas

- **Single file:** all logic lives in `watcher.py` (~2,160 lines after pagination additions). No external modules beyond `requests`.
- **State is committed to git** by the `github-actions` bot after every run. Push conflicts handled by a 5-retry loop with `git merge -X ours`. Remote state is always source of truth; pull before editing state files locally.
- **Scheduling is now EXTERNAL** — cron-job.org calls the `workflow_dispatch` API (watcher every 10 min, boards/boards2 every 30 min). The GitHub `schedule:` cron is a sparse fallback only. Auth = a fine-grained PAT (this repo, Actions:write) stored in **all three** cron-job.org jobs; it **EXPIRES 2026-08-31** and was **EXPOSED IN A SCREENSHOT 2026-07-01** — rotate before expiry and update all three jobs' Authorization header. If all pipelines go silent at once, the PAT is the first suspect.
- **Dead boards: single-strike permanent.** One 404/410 → `boards_dead.add(board_id)` → skipped forever. No retry logic.
- **Dead boards: 921 of 937 are orphaned stale entries.** Only **16 boards** in the current 1,200-row CSV are actually dead. The other 921 are from boards removed in earlier CSV versions — they don't slow down batches.
- **Oracle was broken since day one.** `fetch_oracle` was returning the search container (`items` list, each a dict with `SearchId`, `Keyword`, etc.) instead of `items[0].get("requisitionList")`. This produced `oracle:url:` junk keys and 0 Oracle jobs ever entering `seen.json`. Fixed in commit `804f627b`.
- **GS/IBM/Oracle now paginate.** GS uses `pageNumber` increment; IBM uses `from` offset (Elasticsearch); Oracle uses `limit=50,offset=N` embedded in the finder query string. All three short-circuit when a full page is already in `seen_keys`.
- **New board bootstrap suppresses first-run alerts.** When a board is seen for the first time, all current jobs are added to `seen` silently — no email. Alert lag until second sweep.
- **Cursor persists in `state/boards_cursor.json`.** Wraps to 0 after reaching end of CSV. Full cycle = `ceil(n_boards / batch_size)` runs.
- **Workday URL normalization is complex.** `workday_normalize_external_job_url` handles 5 path shapes. Bugs here produce unclickable links in emails.
- **US location filtering** uses state abbreviation regex + ISO 3166 country-code blocklist. International cities with US-state-like abbreviations were fixed Apr 1 2026.
- **Concurrency:** ThreadPoolExecutor with per-platform semaphores (GH=8, Lever=8, SR=6, WD=4, Ashby=6). Workday is most restrictive.
- **Email:** Gmail SMTP SSL on port 465. Secrets: `EMAIL_USER`, `EMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`, `ALERT_TO_EMAIL`. Subject prefixes per pipeline:
  | Pipeline | Subject prefix | Gmail search |
  |---|---|---|
  | watcher (main) | `[Job Alerts]` | `subject:[Job Alerts]` |
  | boards (boards.yml) | `[Boards Alerts]` | `subject:[Boards Alerts]` |
  | boards2 (boards2.yml) | `[Boards2 Alerts]` | `subject:[Boards2 Alerts]` |
  Override via `SUBJECT_PREFIX` env var in the workflow — absent = falls back to `[Boards Alerts]`.
- **Recall-first philosophy:** a missed job (false negative) is expensive; a junk alert (false positive) is cheap. When in doubt, err toward alerting.
- **Security:** Full git-history scan was clean (no secrets ever committed). `.gitleaks.toml` added with `[extend] useDefault = true` + allowlist for `state/*.json`. The local-only `data/boards/workday_debug/` directory contains HAR files with expired AWS STS credentials — never committed, optional cleanup: `rm -rf data/boards/workday_debug/`.
- **Full architecture reference:** see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — repo map, full function index, runtime traces, external API surface, and ranked risk findings.

## Backlog (later — not urgent)

Evidence gathered 2026-06-02 from ~10 hrs of live dispatch runs (29 main runs, 14 boards runs).
The boards lane is healthy (~250 emails over the window). All items below are main-mode curated-lane gaps.
Note: 100% location pass on Microsoft/Amazon/NVIDIA is expected — those queries are US-filtered upstream, not a bug.

- **Oracle — 0 fetched in every run despite the `804f627b` fix.** Zero Oracle coverage in production. Diagnosis when revisited: run `fetch_oracle` in isolation, inspect the raw API response + extraction key, confirm the fix actually landed in the deployed function.

- **Goldman Sachs — under-fetch + loc_ok=0 always.** Only ~2 jobs fetched per run (single page — pagination likely still broken), and the 1 title-passing job fails `is_us_location` every run. GS is a US company (NYC HQ); suspected location-string format the regex doesn't match. Also threw 403 errors in 2 of 29 runs. Fix plan: fix pagination first, then eyeball real location strings on the larger corpus to diagnose the regex miss.

- **NVIDIA fetches exactly 20, Amazon exactly 300 every run.** Round, stable counts that smell like un-paginated single-page results or hard caps silently truncating the full listing. Confirm both sources paginate to completion (or document why the count is correct).

- **[low] Boards recall spot-check.** Title pass rates (23–37%) and location drop-offs after title (Ashby 24%, Workday 26%) look like normal filtering of all-department global boards, but that's unverified. Someday: eyeball a sample of title-rejected and location-rejected jobs on one high-volume source to confirm the filters aren't dropping real US engineering roles.

## Board expansion — DONE (GH/Lever shard live 2026-07-01)

### Architecture: multi-pipeline sharding (implemented)
The existing 1,200-board pipeline (`boards.yml`) remains **untouched** as the fast lane. New coverage was added as a **separate parallel pipeline** (`boards2.yml`) with its own disjoint CSV, cursor, seen-file, and cron-job.org trigger. This keeps the 1,200 truly untouched and fault-isolated.

**Current system: 3 pipelines, ~7,366 boards total**
| Pipeline | Workflow | Boards | Cadence | Batch size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| watcher | `watcher.yml` | 6 hardcoded companies | 10 min | — |
| boards | `boards.yml` | 1,200 (GH/Lever/SR/WD/Ashby) | 30 min | 200 |
| boards2 | `boards2.yml` | 6,166 (GH+Lever net-new) | 30 min | 2,000 |

### First move: Greenhouse + Lever — COMPLETE
Lead with GH + Lever: cheapest platforms (1 GET/board, ~18 boards/sec on no-WD batches). Liveness-verified 6,407 candidates → 6,166 alive (96.2%), bootstrapped silently, deployed 2026-07-01. First live run 16:39Z: 2,000 boards, 4 new jobs emailed.

Workday = cost driver (4–26 API calls/board, no cheap change-detection): sized and ready to wire. See Workday sizing section below.

### Measurement findings (2026-06-02, from run_log.json + watcher.py inspection)
- **Huge headroom:** 200-board runs finish ~95s avg / 126s max of the 900s timeout (~14% used). Batch 200 is very conservative — adding boards need not hurt per-run latency if batch size scales up.
- **Per-board API cost:** GH = 1 GET; Lever = 1 GET; Ashby = 1 POST; SmartRecruiters = 1–5 GETs; Workday = 1 GET (boot) + 4–25 POSTs. Workday is "the clock."
- **Observed throughput:** ~2.1 boards/sec average; ~18 boards/sec on no-Workday batches (cursor 1000–1200 slice, 0 WD boards, ran in 11.2s).
- **Rate limits:** No throttling evidence from any boards platform at current load; 429s auto-retried transparently; only Goldman Sachs (main mode) threw 403s.
- **Change-detection:** GH & Lever = easy (ETag/304 conditional GET); SmartRecruiters = read `totalFound` on first page and bail early; Ashby & Workday = no HTTP path (both POST), would need app-level count/ID caching.

### Inventory — RESOLVED (2026-07-01)
Verified lists carry **only `company`, `platform`, `board_url`** — no industry, size, or location metadata. Sector/size targeting is NOT possible from these lists alone; needs external enrichment or job-text-level filtering.

**Root cause of prior "zero overlap" false alarm:** Greenhouse hostname differs between the two sources — live CSV uses `boards.greenhouse.io`, verified list uses `job-boards.greenhouse.io`. Comparing raw URLs gave zero overlap even for real matches. Fix: canonical dedup key is `urlparse(board_url).path.split('/')[1].lower()` applied to both sides (strips hostname, takes first path segment, lowercases). Lever URLs are identical on both sides (`jobs.lever.co`); no fix needed there.

**Net-new counts (canonical-slug dedup, confirmed 2026-07-01):**
| Platform | Verified total | Already in live 1,200 | Net-new |
|---|---|---|---|
| Greenhouse | 4,659 | 0 | **4,659** |
| Lever | 1,806 | 0 | **1,806** |
| Combined | 6,465 | 0 | **6,465** |

Zero overlap is genuine — the two pools were seeded from different candidate sources, so all net-new boards represent real new coverage. Zero internal duplicates in either list.

**Data-quality caveat:** ~58 GH slugs (~1.2%) are noise — purely numeric IDs (e.g. `103644278`, `123456789101010`) or >30-char garbage strings. Filter before ingestion.

### GH/Lever shard — liveness-verified, ready to wire up (2026-07-01)

**Liveness probe results (run 2026-07-01, 73s wall time, 24 workers):**
| | Total rows | Net-new vs live 1,200 | Junk dropped | Probed | Alive | Dead |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Greenhouse | 4,659 | 4,659 | 58 (numeric/long slugs) | 4,601 | **4,417 (96.0%)** | 184 |
| Lever | 1,806 | 1,806 | 0 | 1,806 | **1,749 (96.8%)** | 57 |
| **Combined** | **6,465** | **6,465** | **58** | **6,407** | **6,166 (96.2%)** | **241** |

All 241 dead boards were clean 404s — zero timeouts, zero retries needed. Output CSV: **`data/boards/greenhouse_lever_verified_live.csv`** (6,166 rows, same column format as live boards CSV: `company_name, platform, board_url, country_focus, notes`).

**Pipeline built and seeded (2026-07-01):** `boards2.yml` created, all state files bootstrapped locally and committed.

| File | Role | Value at commit |
|---|---|---|
| `data/boards/greenhouse_lever_verified_live.csv` | boards2 CSV | 6,166 boards (GH 4,417 + Lever 1,749) |
| `state/seen_boards2.json` | job dedup (seen-file) | 9,767 job IDs seeded |
| `state/boards2_seen.json` | bootstrap tracking | 6,166 board IDs |
| `state/boards2_cursor.json` | batch cursor | 0 (fully cycled in bootstrap) |
| `state/boards2_dead.json` | dead boards | 0 (clean CSV going in) |
| `.github/workflows/boards2.yml` | workflow | batch_size=2000, cron fallback `43 */3 * * *`, concurrency=`job-watcher-boards2` |

All five env vars are disjoint — `STATE_PATH`, `BOARDS_CURSOR_PATH`, `BOARDS_SEEN_PATH`, `BOARDS_DEAD_PATH`, `BOARDS_DEAD_DETAILS_PATH` — so boards2 cannot collide with the live 1,200 pipeline.

**LIVE as of 2026-07-01T16:39Z.** First `workflow_dispatch` run confirmed success: processed 2,000 GH boards (cursor 0→2000), fetched 57,985 jobs, 3,524 loc_ok, 4 new/emailed, 19s. `seen_boards2.json` grew 9,767→9,771; `boards2_cursor.json`=2000; `seen_boards.json` (live 1,200) untouched. 30-min cadence confirmed. All three cron-job.org jobs share PAT expiring **2026-08-31** — **exposed in screenshot 2026-07-01, rotate soon**.

### Open questions (deferred)
- Job-text eligibility filter across ALL pipelines: drop roles requiring security clearance / "US citizen or PR required" / ITAR (ineligible on OPT); optionally flag "no sponsorship" (H-1B needed later). High value, situation-specific.

## Workday boards3 — BUILT and seeded (2026-07-09), dormant awaiting cron-job.org trigger

**boards3 is the first Workday shard (Shard A, 2,325 boards). boards4 (Shard B, 2,326 boards) is pre-split and ready — see `data/boards/workday_shard_b.csv`.**

### Pipeline

| File | Value |
|---|---|
| Workflow | `.github/workflows/boards3.yml` |
| CSV | `data/boards/workday_shard_a.csv` (2,325 rows, boards 0–2324 of workday_verified_live.csv) |
| batch_size | 20 (reduced from initial 50 — see timeout analysis below) |
| HTTP_TIMEOUT | 30s (Workday API is slower than GH/Lever) |
| SUBJECT_PREFIX | `[Boards3 Alerts]` |
| Concurrency group | `job-watcher-boards3` |
| Sparse fallback cron | `53 */3 * * *` (distinct from boards=13, boards2=43) |
| Cursor at commit | 0 |
| seen_boards3.json at commit | `[]` (empty — per-board bootstrap seeds silently on first encounter) |

### Batch size — timeout analysis (2026-07-09)

Initial batch_size=50 was wrong. First successful run (2026-07-09T01:30Z) measured:
- Wall time: **609.5s = 10.2 min** at avg 75.21s/board (production is 1.86× slower than sizing probe's 40.5s avg)
- At sizing p90 (107.7s/board): 50×107.7/4 = **1,346s = 22.4 min** → exceeds 15-min Actions limit
- Runs killed mid-batch leave cursor unchanged → permanent stall, zero boards swept

**batch_size=20** fits the 10-min / 60%-budget target at p90:
- p90 estimate: 20×107.7/4 = **539s = 9.0 min** ✓
- Observed avg case: 609.5 × 20/50 = **244s = 4.1 min** ✓

**Cadence consequence:** 2,325 boards ÷ 20/run = 117 runs × 30 min = **58.5h ≈ 2.4-day full cycle** (was 23.5h at batch=50). Acceptable for Workday (jobs update less frequently than GH/Lever). A `[WARN]` is now printed if any boards-mode run exceeds 720s (12 min), giving early signal before a timeout becomes systematic.

### Bootstrap approach

No local full-sweep bootstrap was run (unlike boards2). Reason: with WD_SEM=4 and ~40s avg/board, a full 2,325-board local sweep would take ~6.5 hours — impractical in-session. It's also unnecessary: `suppress_new_boards=True` is always active in non-test mode. On every workflow run, boards not yet in `boards3_seen.json` have their jobs silently added to `seen_boards3.json` (via `bootstrap_keys`) before the new-job check — so they can never trigger an email alert. This means the first ~47 runs (47 × 50-board batches = full cycle) each self-bootstrap silently. **No historical Workday jobs will be emailed.**

The first ever run (batch 0–49) will additionally fire the file-level bootstrap (seen_boards3.json exists but is empty, so `os.path.exists` is True and bootstrap does NOT fire — per-board bootstrap handles it instead).

### boards4 (future, pre-split)

`data/boards/workday_shard_b.csv` — 2,326 boards (rows 2325–4650 of workday_verified_live.csv, starting at Ioausa). Zero overlap with shard A (verified). Wire up as boards4.yml when ready — trivial clone of boards3.yml with different CSV + state paths + subject prefix + cron offset.

### STATUS: LIVE (cron-job.org trigger enabled 2026-07-09)

First successful run: 2026-07-09T01:30Z — 50 boards (batch=50, pre-fix), 609.5s, cursor 0→50, 81 job IDs seeded in seen_boards3.json. No emails sent. Batch reduced to 20 immediately after; all subsequent runs use batch=20.

### Workday decisions — record for future sessions

**boards3 is final as-is. No further splitting.** boards3 = workday_shard_a.csv, batch_size=20, ~58h full cycle. Deliberate tradeoff: coverage over freshness. Workday jobs change less frequently than GH/Lever; a 2.4-day cycle is acceptable.

**Future Workday expansion (workday_shard_b.csv):** The second half (2,326 boards, Ioausa→Zuehlke) is pre-split at `data/boards/workday_shard_b.csv` and unused. When adding it, **decide the naming scheme UP FRONT** before building — retrofitting `state/boards4_*.json` → `state/boardsX_*.json` after cron-job.org is wired is error-prone. Choose the final pipeline name (boards4? workday_b?) at design time.

**Production Workday is ~1.86× slower than the sizing probe** (observed 75.21s/board avg vs probe's 40.5s). The sizing report's `batch_size=50` recommendation contradicted its own p90 math (p90 conservative cap = 26 boards/run). **Any future Workday shard must start at batch_size=20, not 50.** Validate after first live run; adjust if avg latency differs.

**Duration guard:** `[WARN]` printed in watcher.py when any boards-mode run exceeds 720s (12 min). Applies to all four pipelines; only boards3 will realistically approach it. If the WARN fires consistently, reduce batch_size before timeouts become systematic.

## Workday boards3 — sized, NOT built (2026-07-01) [SUPERSEDED — see above]

### Sizing findings (`workday_us_verified.csv` → `data/boards/workday_verified_live.csv`)

| | Count | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Source rows | 4,770 | `workday_us_verified.csv` |
| Junk/dupes removed | 2 | 1 junk slug, 1 internal dupe |
| Already in live 1200 | 77 | excluded, not net-new |
| Net-new probed | 4,768 | — |
| **Alive (has openings)** | **4,497 (94.3%)** | in output CSV |
| Alive (no current openings) | 154 (3.2%) | in output CSV — can get jobs later |
| Dead (4xx/WAF) | 59+16 | 16 are WAF-blocked (403), not rate-limited |
| **Total live CSV** | **4,651 rows** | `data/boards/workday_verified_live.csv` |

**Cost sample** — 200 boards, full `fetch_workday_jobs()` with `max_positions=500`:
| Metric | avg | p90 | p95 |
|---|---|---|---|
| api_calls / board | 21.5 | 26 | 26 |
| response_time / board | 40.5s | 107.7s | — |
| jobs / board | 404 | 500 | — |

p90 api_calls = 26 (= 25 POSTs + 1 GET) means the majority of large boards hit the 500-job cap. p90 wall-time = 107.7s/board (sequential per thread). Zero 429s observed at concurrency=20.

**Rate-limit signal: NONE.** 16 boards returned 403 — those are per-tenant WAF blocks, not throughput limits. Workday CXS has no observed rate-limiting at reasonable concurrency.

### Sizing math & recommendation

| | Value |
|---|---|
| Effective budget / run | 720s (15 min × 80%) |
| WD concurrency in watcher | 4 threads (WD_SEM=4) |
| Boards / run @ p90 latency | 26 (conservative cap) |
| Boards / run @ avg latency | 71 |
| **Recommended batch_size** | **50** (floor-capped for safety) |
| Runs to full cycle (4,497 alive) | 90 |
| Cycle time @ 30 min cadence | **45h** |

**45h cycle is too slow for a single shard.** Recommendation: **two shards** — `boards3a.yml` + `boards3b.yml`, ~2,325 boards each, staggered 15 min apart. Each shard cycles in ~22.5h, acceptable for a supplementary Workday lane (new Workday jobs are generally posted less frequently than GH/Lever).

### Design notes for when boards3 is built
- CSV is drop-in ready (`company_name, platform, board_url, country_focus, notes` columns, same as live)
- All 5 state env vars must be unique per shard (same pattern as boards2)
- `batch_size=50` with `timeout=15` keeps each run well within 15-min Actions limit
- Stagger the two cron-job.org jobs by 15 min to avoid simultaneous Workday load
- No overlap with boards2 (GH/Lever only) — 0 shared boards
- Consider Workday `--boards-batch-size 50` and revisit after measuring first live run

## Workday probe redesign (PROPOSED, not built)

An external review (2026-07-09) identified that boards3 does a full crawl of every board every cycle — 21.5 API calls/board on average — to answer a question that costs 1 call in the steady state.

**Proposed steady-state probe:** 1 POST: page 1, limit=20, offset=0. Diff those 20 IDs against the seen-file. All 20 seen → board is quiet; done (1 call total). Any unseen → page forward until a fully-seen page is found (typically 1–3 extra pages for active boards).

**Critical unverified assumption:** This rests on Workday CXS default ordering (empty `searchText`) being **newest-first by posted date**. This is **UNVERIFIED**. If any tenant sorts by something else (alphabetical, relevance), the probe reads 20 old jobs, concludes "no news," and that board goes silently dark forever. The silent-source alarm cannot detect this — a deep fetch never fires, so the counter stays at 0.

**Prerequisites before building:**
1. **Calibration crawl:** For a sample of tenants (≥50 boards across size tiers), compare page-1 IDs on two consecutive deep fetches. Confirm new jobs appear on page 1. Validates newest-first ordering empirically.
2. **Safety net by construction — candidates:**
   - Explicit sort parameter in the CXS API (if it exists) — safest if documented.
   - `total`-delta cross-check: if job count unchanged since last visit, skip. Weak: add+remove cancels, so count unchanged ≠ board unchanged.
   - Rotating randomized deep-crawl audit: ~2% of boards per run get a full fetch regardless. Covers every board statistically in ~50 runs (~25 days). Silent-recall holes surface within a month.

**Projected gain if safe:** 2,325 boards × 1 call ÷ 4 threads ≈ 9.7 min for the entire Workday estate (vs. 58.5h full cycle currently). The unused `data/boards/workday_shard_b.csv` (2,326 boards) becomes absorbable for free — both shards in one 30-min run.

**Also proposed:** Raise the Workday concurrency semaphore above 4 (zero rate-limiting observed across 4,651 probed boards; distinct hostnames suggest per-tenant isolation). Verify shared WAF behavior first. Do NOT use `searchText` to narrow server-side (opaque relevance = silent recall loss). The `locationCountry` facet is safer but must fail open.

**Status: Proposed only. No code written. Do not build before the calibration crawl.**

---

## Open review items (from external critique, not yet decided)

Items raised 2026-07-09. None implemented. Each is a decision point, not a filed bug.

- **Circuit breaker on send:** If a run would email >~200 jobs, quarantine the batch to a file, alert once with the count, require manual release. Do not abort (loses the batch); do not advance `seen_ids` before email (silent recall loss). Threshold needs a baseline of normal volumes first.

- **Audit send/commit ordering:** `seen_ids` is committed after successful email send (email-then-commit = at-least-once). If the git push fails after 5 retries, the next run re-emails the same jobs. This is the correct failure mode (duplicate alert vs. silent miss) — worth documenting so it's not "fixed" by accident into at-most-once.

- **Golden-set tests for `classify_title` / `is_us_location`:** A CSV of (input → expected output) covering every past bug as a regression case. Highest recall-safety ROI per effort; still not built. The classifier has been widened additive-only so far with no automated verification.

- **Rolling-baseline drop detection:** The 3-consecutive-zeros alarm misses sources that fetch a nonzero but suspiciously low count — GS (~2 jobs/run, never zero) or NVIDIA (pinned at exactly 20, suggesting a hard cap). An EWMA-based "N-sigma below recent average" alarm or a frozen-count detector would catch these. Not implemented.

- **Pagination-cap detector:** For sources that expose `total` (Amazon, IBM, Oracle), assert `len(collected) >= min(total, cap)`. A silent cap truncating real jobs is currently undetectable.

- **Per-board productivity tracking → slow-tier demotion:** Track jobs-emailed per board over a rolling window. Zero-productivity boards over ~30 days could be swept weekly instead of every cycle. Do NOT prune — a quiet board may post a target role tomorrow. Pruning is a recall decision disguised as efficiency.

- **Sampled reject storage:** Keep ~100% of near-miss rejects (passed title, failed location; or `"maybe"` not `"yes"`). Keep 1–5% of clear rejects (`classify_title == "no"`) for periodic audits. This is where silent recall loss most often hides.

- **First-seen → first-emailed latency:** Store `posted_at` (from source), `first_seen_utc` (when key first enters `seen_ids`, not when emailed), and `first_emailed_utc`. The gap validates the project's premise. Currently `emailed_*.json` sets `first_seen_utc = emailed_utc` — they're the same field today.

- **Structural — 4 copy-pasted pipelines:** `watcher.yml` / `boards.yml` / `boards2.yml` / `boards3.yml` share identical commit/push logic. The `run_log.json` race, boards3 schema crash, and subject-prefix omissions were all copy-paste drift bugs. A config-table-driven single code path would prevent this. **Not now** — after Workday probe redesign, when the pipeline count stabilizes.

- **Structural — `main` pipeline's 6 bespoke scrapers:** 4 of the 10 known bugs were in main mode. NVIDIA is on Workday CXS; Microsoft is on Eightfold — both have proven ATS adapters in the boards pipeline. Retiring bespoke scrapers onto proven ATS paths would reduce maintenance surface but would sacrifice the 10-min priority cadence.

- **Security — public repo exposes state:** Repo is public to lift the Actions free-tier minutes cap. `state/emailed_*.json` exposes emailed job records, target companies, and classification decisions publicly. Consider code-public / state-private (separate branch + restricted Actions). Not urgent while PAT rotation is the higher risk.

- **PAT rotation (deadline 2026-08-31):** GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Fine-grained tokens → new token (repo: ms-job-watcher, Actions: Read and Write) → paste `Bearer <new-token>` into Authorization header of **all four** cron-job.org jobs → test each (expect HTTP 204) → revoke old token. The watchdog catches expiry within 24h but does not prevent the outage.

## Recent changes

- **2026-07-08 (session summary)** — Tracking layer COMPLETE and verified. (1) Schema validation on all state-file loaders: JSON parse failure on `seen_ids`/`run_log` → `[FATAL]` + exit 1 (empty fallback = re-alert flood or log corruption); parse failure on `cursor`/`boards_seen`/`boards_dead` → `[ERROR]` + safe default (recovers next run); wrong type anywhere → `[FATAL]` + exit 1. (2) Silent-source alarm: per-pipeline `state/source_health_{pipeline}.json` tracks consecutive zero-fetch runs per source; 3 consecutive → `[Watcher ALERT]` aggregate email; fetch errors skip the counter (error ≠ silence). Boards mode: 3 consecutive batches where known boards return 0 total fetched. (3) Daily watchdog: `scripts/watchdog.py` + `.github/workflows/watchdog.yml`, fires 09:00 UTC GitHub-native schedule (no cron-job.org PAT), checks last successful run via `GITHUB_TOKEN` (auto-provided, read-only Actions:read); API errors skipped, never-ran treated as stale. Verified 2026-07-09T02:24Z: all four pipelines healthy, no false alert, 8s runtime. Job storage: every emailed job recorded per-pipeline to `state/emailed_{pipeline}.json`; queryable via `scripts/show_emailed.py --since N --pipeline X --bucket yes/maybe`.

- **2026-07-08** — Watchdog workflow added (commit `9bce127b3`). `scripts/watchdog.py` + `.github/workflows/watchdog.yml`. Fires daily at 09:00 UTC via GitHub-native `schedule:` — independent of cron-job.org PAT. Checks each pipeline's last successful run via `GITHUB_TOKEN` (auto-provided, no custom PAT). Thresholds: main >20 min (2× 10-min cadence), boards/boards2/boards3 >60 min (2× 30-min cadence). Sends one aggregate `[Watcher ALERT]` email per day if any pipeline is stale. API errors are skipped (state unknown ≠ stale); "no successful runs found" is treated as stale. If the cron-job.org PAT expires and all four pipelines go silent simultaneously, the watchdog will catch it within 24 hours.

- **2026-07-08** — Silent-source alarm added (commit `a73d06f6c`). Per-pipeline health state in `state/source_health_{pipeline}.json` (`{"consecutive_zeros": {"oracle": 3, ...}}`). Main mode: tracks zero-fetch runs per SUPPORTED_SOURCE; emails `[Watcher ALERT]` after 3 consecutive zeros, skips sources that errored (error ≠ silence). Boards mode: tracks consecutive batches where known boards return 0 total fetched jobs. All four pipelines independently tracked — no shared-file race. Parse errors on health file reset counters with [ERROR] log rather than killing the run (health loss is acceptable; pipeline must keep running).

- **2026-07-08** — Schema validation added to all state-file loaders (commit `054cd0e3b`). Two-tier error handling:
  - **JSON parse failure:** `[FATAL]` + exit 1 for `seen_ids` (empty fallback = re-alert flood) and `run_log` (local write, not a concurrent-rebase target). `[ERROR]` + safe default for `cursor` (→0), `boards_seen` (→∅), `boards_dead` (→∅) — these recover on the next run if the partial read was transient.
  - **Wrong schema type:** `[FATAL]` + exit 1 everywhere — message names the file, expected key/type, and actual type. This is the exact bug that crashed boards3's first run (seen_boards3.json was `[]` instead of `{"seen_ids": []}`).
  - Covers: `load_seen_ids`, `load_boards_cursor`, `load_boards_seen`, `load_boards_dead`, `_append_run_log`.

- **2026-07-09** — boards3 batch_size reduced 50→20 after first successful run showed 609.5s (10.2 min) at avg latency; p90 estimate (107.7s/board) projects 1,346s = 22.4 min at batch=50, exceeding the 15-min Actions limit. batch=20 projects 539s at p90 (9.0 min, 60% budget). New full-cycle time: 117 runs × 30 min = 58.5h ≈ 2.4 days. Duration guard added to watcher.py: prints [WARN] if any boards-mode run exceeds 720s.
- **2026-07-09** — boards3 built and seeded (Workday Shard A, 2,325 boards). `boards3.yml` created (batch_size=50, HTTP_TIMEOUT=30, sparse cron `53 */3 * * *`, concurrency=`job-watcher-boards3`, SUBJECT_PREFIX=`[Boards3 Alerts]`). State files committed empty — per-board bootstrap (`suppress_new_boards=True`) silently seeds new boards on first encounter, so no historical email blast. `workday_shard_a.csv` (rows 0–2324) and `workday_shard_b.csv` (rows 2325–4650, ready for future boards4) split from `workday_verified_live.csv` (zero overlap verified). boards3 is DORMANT — wire up cron-job.org dispatch trigger to activate.
- **2026-07-06** — Per-pipeline email subject prefixes added. `SUBJECT_PREFIX` env var in boards2.yml sets `[Boards2 Alerts]`; boards1 keeps `[Boards Alerts]`; main keeps `[Job Alerts]`. Gmail searches: `subject:[Job Alerts]` (main), `subject:[Boards Alerts]` (boards1), `subject:[Boards2 Alerts]` (boards2/GH+Lever shard).
- **2026-07-06 — FALSE ALARM: boards2 was never broken.** Earlier diagnostic (reading run_log.json) concluded boards2 ran only ~34 times over 5 days (3.4h cadence). **This was wrong.** `gh run list` confirms boards2 ran **273 times Jul 1–6** with a **perfect 30-min median gap and zero gaps > 60 min** (242 workflow_dispatch + 31 schedule, all success). The "34 runs" figure was a run_log.json artifact: run_log is a bounded 1000-entry JSON array rewritten in full by every pipeline. With main firing 6× more often than boards2, main's concurrent writes win the merge conflict race almost every time — run_log currently shows **0 boards2 entries** despite 273 actual runs. boards2_cursor.json advancing (0→2000→4000→6000) is the reliable signal that boards2 is sweeping correctly. **Do not re-investigate boards2 cadence based on run_log.json counts alone — use `gh run list --workflow=boards2.yml` instead.**

- **2026-07-01** — Workday boards3 sizing complete. Probed 4,768 net-new WD boards: 4,651 alive (97.5%), 77 already in live 1200. Cost sample (200 boards): avg 21.5 API calls/board, p90 40.5s/board wall time. Recommendation: batch_size=50, two shards (boards3a+b ~2,325 each), 30-min cadence → ~22.5h cycle per shard. Live CSV: `data/boards/workday_verified_live.csv` (4,651 rows). Report: `data/boards/workday_sizing_report.txt`. No pipeline built yet.
- **2026-07-01** — `classify_title` widened for data-engineering family (additive only, commit `595355dc`). Added to `STRONG_INCLUDE_PHRASES`: `"dataops"`, `"data ops"`, `"data operations engineer"`, `"data architect"`, `"data quality engineer"`. Added `has_dqe` carve-out in the hard-exclude loop so "Data Quality Engineer" is not blocked by the existing `"quality engineer"` hard-exclude (parallel to SDET exception). No existing terms removed or narrowed. Previously missed: DataOps Engineer, Data Operations Engineer (both dropped by "ops"/"operations" soft-exclude with no STRONG override); Data Architect (no weak/strong match); Data Quality Engineer (hard-excluded). All now pass. QA/DevOps exclusions unaffected.

- **2026-07-01** — boards2 LIVE. First workflow_dispatch at 16:39Z: success, 2,000 GH boards, 4 new jobs emailed, cursor→2000, boards2 state files updated, live-1200 state untouched. 30-min cadence confirmed. PAT shared by all 3 cron-job.org jobs expires 2026-08-31 — **exposed in screenshot 2026-07-01, rotate soon**. System now sweeps ~7,366 total boards across 3 pipelines.
- **2026-07-01** — boards2 pipeline built and seeded. `boards2.yml` created (batch_size=2000, cron fallback `43 */3 * * *`, concurrency=`job-watcher-boards2`). Bootstrap run seeded `seen_boards2.json` with 9,767 job IDs across 6,166 boards (181s). All state paths disjoint. Awaiting cron-job.org trigger (manual browser step).
- **2026-07-01** — Liveness probe complete. Probed 6,407 net-new GH+Lever boards in 73s; 6,166 alive (96.2%), 241 dead (all clean 404s). Output: `data/boards/greenhouse_lever_verified_live.csv`. Shard pipeline is the only remaining step.
- **2026-07-01** — Inventory unblocked. Root cause of zero-overlap false alarm: GH hostname mismatch (`boards.greenhouse.io` vs `job-boards.greenhouse.io`). Canonical dedup key: `urlparse(url).path.split('/')[1].lower()`. Net-new: GH 4,659 + Lever 1,806 = 6,465 (all genuinely new, 0 overlap with live 1,200). GH/Lever shard marked ready to build.
- **2026-06-02** — Expansion plan designed + budget measured. Multi-pipeline shard architecture decided; GH/Lever first move agreed. Verified-list inventory started (URL-format mismatch blocked net-new count — resume next session). See "Future roadmap" section above.
- **2026-06-02** — External triggering verified in production. `gh run list` confirms `event=workflow_dispatch` runs at 20:40 and 20:50 UTC (exactly 10 min apart, all success); boards dispatch also confirmed. Multi-hour latency fully resolved.
- **2026-06-02** — `ci: switch to external dispatch trigger — downgrade schedule to sparse fallback`. cron-job.org now drives both workflows (watcher 10 min, boards 30 min) via `workflow_dispatch` API (HTTP 204 verified). GitHub `schedule:` downgraded to `13 */3 * * *` (sparse fallback). PAT expires 2026-08-31.
- **2026-06-02** — Cadence audit: measured 10 watcher + 9 boards gaps post-Jun-1 cron change. Watcher median 268 min (target 10 min), boards median 273 min (target 30 min) — both worse than pre-change baseline. GitHub cron deprioritization confirmed; must move off Actions cron entirely.
- **2026-06-02** — `feat: add per-run funnel observability to state/run_log.json` (`d0d51894`). Both modes now record `{ts, mode, per_source: {src: {fetched, title_ok, loc_ok, new, emailed, error/errors}}, duration_s, cursor}` to `state/run_log.json` (bounded 1,000 records, picked up by existing `git add state/*.json`). Also prints a one-line summary to Actions log each run.
- **2026-06-01** — `fix: paginate Goldman Sachs, IBM, Oracle — fix Oracle requisitionList extraction` (`804f627b`). Oracle was broken since day one; now fixed. All three sources paginate fully.
- **2026-06-01** — `ci: improve cron cadence — watcher 10min offset, boards 30min offset` (`f7a5c236`). Moved off congested `:00/:15/:30/:45` slots.
- **2026-06-01** — `config: add .gitleaks.toml` (`1e06172d`). Suppresses `state/*.json` false positives while keeping default secret detectors active.
- **2026-06-01** — Full architecture audit: created `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`; corrected dead-board count (16 active, 921 orphaned); confirmed Actions throttling as primary latency risk; identified GS/IBM/Oracle pagination gaps (now fixed).
- **2026-06-01** — Added `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/STATE.md` for persistent project memory. Repo made **public** (unlimited Actions minutes).
